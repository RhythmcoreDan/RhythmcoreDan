# Hi, I'm Dan 👋  

I build modular algorithmic trading systems in Python — focusing on clean architecture, emotional/behavioral market modeling, regime detection, and automated execution.

### 🔧 What I Work On
- Real-time data ingestion  
- Custom indicators (EMO Index, Regime Map, composites)  
- Execution engines and API integration  
- Backtesting + forward testing  
- Automated monitoring and alert pipelines  

### 📦 Featured Projects
- **[rhythmcore-demo-bot](https://github.com/RhythmcoreDan/rhythmcore-demo-bot)** — bot architecture demo  
- **[emo-index-demo](https://github.com/RhythmcoreDan/emo-index-demo)** — emotional-behavior indicator demo  

Always building. Always improving.
