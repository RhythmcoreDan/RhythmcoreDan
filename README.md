# Hi, I'm Dan 👋  
**Python Algo Engineer | System Architect | Creator of RhythmCore**

I build full-stack algorithmic trading systems using clean, modular, testable Python architecture.  
Each component is designed as an independent piece of a larger engine — indicators, regimes, signals, execution, and backtesting — all working together.

---

## 🧠 What I Build
- **Custom Indicators**  
  Emotional/behavioral engines, volatility tools, wick/trend composites.
  
- **Market Regime Models**  
  Trend detection, chop classification, volatility regimes, state mapping.

- **Strategy & Signal Logic**  
  Structured signal pipelines and decision layers.

- **Execution Engines**  
  Position tracking, trade accounting, PnL and equity curve generation.

- **Backtesting Systems**  
  Performance metrics, drawdowns, trade stats, simulation loops.

### 1. **[rhythmcore-demo-bot](https://github.com/RhythmcoreDan/rhythmcore-demo-bot)**  
Signal engine + strategy logic + backtesting loop.

### 2. **[emo-index-demo](https://github.com/RhythmcoreDan/emo-index-demo)**  
Emotional/behavior indicator (volatility, wick ratio, composites).

### 3. **[regime-map-demo](https://github.com/RhythmcoreDan/regime-map-demo)**  
Market regime classifier (trend vs chop, high vs low volatility).

### 4. **[execution-engine-demo](https://github.com/RhythmcoreDan/execution-engine-demo)**  
Position engine with realized/unrealized PnL and equity tracking.

### 5. **[backtester-demo](https://github.com/RhythmcoreDan/backtester-demo)**

## ⚙️ My Engineering Philosophy  
Build systems like machines:

- Modular  
- Predictable  
- Maintainable  
- Extensible  
- Testable  

**Small components → Large systems.  
Clear logic → Scalable architecture.**
