# Hi, I'm Dan 👋  
**Python Algo Engineer | System Architect | Creator of RhythmCore**

I build modular algorithmic trading systems with clean, testable Python architecture.  
Everything I create is structured as independent components — signals, indicators, regimes, and execution — designed to plug together into full trading pipelines.

---

## 🧠 What I Build
- **Custom Indicators**  
  Behavioral/emotional models, volatility tools, wick analysis, trend composites.

- **Market Regime Engines**  
  Trend vs chop detection, volatility states, state classification maps.

- **Execution Systems**  
  Position management, PnL accounting, equity tracking, order logic.

- **Strategy & Bot Architecture**  
  Signal generation, backtesting structure, processing pipelines.

## 🔧 Core Demo Modules  
These repos demonstrate the modular building blocks of a complete trading system:

### 🌐 **1. [rhythmcore-demo-bot](https://github.com/RhythmcoreDan/rhythmcore-demo-bot)**  
Strategy structure, signals, backtesting loop, and clean architecture.

### 🔥 **2. [emo-index-demo](https://github.com/RhythmcoreDan/emo-index-demo)**  
Emotional/behavioral indicator using volatility, wicks, and composite scoring.

### 📊 **3. [regime-map-demo](https://github.com/RhythmcoreDan/regime-map-demo)**  
Market regime classification (trend/chop + volatility levels).

### ⚙️ **4. [execution-engine-demo](https://github.com/RhythmcoreDan/execution-engine-demo)**  
Position tracking, realized/unrealized PnL, and running equity.

## 🚀 Philosophy  
I build trading systems the same way you’d build industrial machines:

- Modular  
- Testable  
- Consistent  
- Maintainable  
- Extensible  

Small components → Large systems.  
Clear logic → Scalable structure.
